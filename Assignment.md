## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### 1. **Pull Requests**
- **Expectation 👀**  
  PRs are for big teams; I’d just push straight to `main`.
- **Reality 😅**  
  A quick self-review in a PR catches silly mistakes . GitHub even flags conflicts for me.
- **Impact 💻**  
  Every feature now goes through a PR. Spotted a footer typo and fixed it *before* it went live.


### 2. **Branching**
- **Expectation 👀**  
  Why just not use one branch?
- **Reality 😅**  
  Putting each Issue on its own branch keeps `main` clean. If an idea fails, I delete the branch with no consequences.
- **Impact 💻**  
  Used branches like `feature/7-contact-form`; testing new features before pushing to main.


### 3. **Commit Messaging**
- **Expectation 👀**  
  “Fix stuff” was good enough; I’d remember what I meant.
- **Reality 😅**  
  Conventional tags (`feat`, `style`, `docs`) ensure every commit has a clear description for future reference .
- **Impact 💻**  
  When writing my course summary, the commit history already told the story , i didn't need to guess.


### 4. **Project Management / Kanban**
- **Expectation 👀**  
  The board looked nice but not necessary.
- **Reality 😅**  
  Dragging cards from **To Do** → **Done** shows gaps I’d otherwise miss.
- **Impact 💻**  
  “About Me polish” was still in **To Do** ,the board reminded me before the set deadline.
